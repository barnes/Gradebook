## A dead simple todo list using Quasar & Firebase.

- Quasar Frontend, basic layout. A home page, a completed page. 
- Firebase Backend, dead simple schema, task, id, completed, dateAdded
- Clean up, speed up. Find ways to make this run as fast as possible.
- Deploy to web and Android, test on both, maybe utilize daily.
