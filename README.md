## A dead simple todo list using Quasar & Firebase.

- Quasar Frontend, basic layout. A home page, a completed page. 
- Firebase Backend, dead simple schema, task, id, completed, dateAdded
- Clean up, speed up. Find ways to make this run as fast as possible.
- Deploy to web and Android, test on both, maybe utilize daily.

Basic layout is there. A form, a card. Done. Starting to link the buttons to script actions, getting snagged. Firebase installed, bootfile created, config in there.

Test page functional. Need to implment date and sorting by date. Add on from there. Firebase is running great.

Categories started, dates functional. Need a selector with the ability to add a new option for category, feel like I've got it pretty close. Want to add sorting by category and by date.
